# Acadnet.dev
This is the source code for the Acadnet.dev platform.

## Project idea
The use for this platform is to allow students to practice their engineering skills solving bugs in coding problems. The platform will provide a set of problems that can be solved with a variety of difficulty levels.

Users will be able to solve the problems online in a VSCode environment and submit their solutions for evaluation.
